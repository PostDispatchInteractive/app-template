What is this?
-------------

This is a St. Louis Post-Dispatch interactive project, built using a modified version of NPR's [app template](https://github.com/nprapps/app-template/)

Assumptions
-----------

The following things are assumed to be true in this documentation.

* You are running OSX.
* You are using Python 2.7. (Probably the version that came OSX.)
* You have [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and [virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper) installed and working.

For more details on the technology stack used with the app-template, see NPR's [development environment blog post](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2013/06/06/how-to-setup-a-developers-environment.html).
